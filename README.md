A slim library to register subscriber addresses and store them in a subscriber DB.

# Summary

Just three HTTP endpoints are provided:

* ```GET /interest.js``` - A javascript file to provide async POST functionality
* ```POST /interested``` - A POST endpoint to which the registered addresses (and the site that referred them) can be POSTed for storage. Params: ```email``` and ```referrer```
* ```GET /interested``` - A GET endpoint that returns registered addresses symmetrically encrypted using Fernet. The Fernet key should be set as a server-side environment variable called ```FERNET_KEY```

A file is provided, ```decrypt_file.py``` that reads the ```FERNET_KEY``` environment variable and uses it to decrypt messages generated within **10 minutes** of them being generated by the endpoint.

# Usage

It's a python flask app, so use in the normal way. A ```Procfile``` has been provided for those who are Heroku minded, with a MongoHQ example URI.
